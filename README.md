# website_download
How do I download a website (all coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and make a similar website in Bootstrap?


If you know how to run npm , then there is one Useful script .

# But first , do:

npm install website-scraper

# And in that directory run

node index.js

This takes some time. So be patient and if everything goes well, you will get a message in your console:

Entire website succesfully downloaded
